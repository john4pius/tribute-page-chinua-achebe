                                    and on 10 September 1961 they were married in the Chapel of Resurrection on the campus of the University of Ibadan. Christie Achebe has described their marriage as one of trust and mutual understanding"

                                    the discussion about the Nigerian Civil War.“

                                <li>
                                    <strong> Use of English</strong> “As the decolonisation process unfolded in the 1950s, a debate about choice of language erupted and pursued authors around the world; Achebe was no exception.“

                                <li>
                                    <strong> Themes</strong> “Achebe's novels approach a variety of themes. In his early writing, a depiction of the Igbo culture itself is paramount.“

                                <li>
                                    <strong> Culture and colonialism</strong> “A prevalent theme in Achebe's novels is the intersection of African tradition (particularly Igbo varieties) and modernity, especially as embodied by European colonialism.“
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    <strong> Masculinity and femininity</strong> “The gender roles of men and women, as well as societies' conceptions of the associated concepts, are frequent themes in Achebe's writing. He has been criticised as a sexist
                                    author, in response to what many call the uncritical depiction of traditionally patriarchal Igbo society, where the most masculine men take numerous wives, and women are beaten regularly.“
                                </li>

                                <li>
                                    <strong> Legacy</strong> “Achebe has been called "the father of modern African writing" and Africa's greatest storyteller, and many books and essays have been written about his work over the past fifty years.“
