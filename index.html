                        Chinua Achebe (born Albert Chinụalụmọgụ Achebe, 16 November 1930 – 21 March 2013) was a Nigerian novelist, poet, professor, and critic. His first novel Things Fall Apart (1958), often considered his masterpiece, is the most widely read book in modern
                        African literature.

                <h2>Key events in the life of Chinua Achebe</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Early Life - </strong> "Achebe was born Albert Chinualumogu Achebe in the Igbo village of Ogidi on 16 November 1930."
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Education - </strong> "In 1936, Achebe entered St Philips' Central School. Despite his protests, he spent a week in the religious class for young children, but was quickly moved to a higher class when the school's chaplain
                        took note of his intelligence."
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>University - </strong> "Achebe was admitted as a Major Scholar in the university's first intake and given a bursary to study medicine."
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Teaching and producing - </strong> "As a teacher he urged his students to read extensively and be original in their work."
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Things Fall Apart - </strong> "Back in Nigeria, Achebe set to work revising and editing his novel (now titled Things Fall Apart, after a line in the poem "The Second Coming" by W. B. Yeats)."
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Marriage and family - </strong> "In the same year Things Fall Apart was published, Achebe was promoted at the NBS and put in charge of the network's eastern region coverage. He moved to Enugu and began to work on his administrative
                        duties. There he met a woman named Christiana Chinwe (Christie) Okoli, who had grown up in the area and joined the NBS staff when he arrived. Achebe and Okoli grew closer in the following years, and on 10 September 1961 they were
                        married in the Chapel of Resurrection on the campus of the University of Ibadan.[49] Christie Achebe has described their marriage as one of trust and mutual understanding"
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>No Longer at Ease and fellowship travels</strong> “In 1960, while they were still dating, Achebe dedicated to Christie Okoli his second novel, No Longer at Ease, about a civil servant who is embroiled in the corruption
                        of Lagos.”
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong> Voice of Nigeria and African Writers Series</strong> “Once he returned to Nigeria, Achebe was promoted at the NBS to the position of Director of External Broadcasting. One of his first duties was to help create the Voice
                        of Nigeria network. The station broadcast its first transmission on New Year's Day 1962, and worked to maintain an objective perspective during the turbulent era immediately following independence. This objectivity was put to the
                        test when Nigerian Prime Minister Abubakar Tafawa Balewa declared a state of emergency in the Western Region, responding to a series of conflicts between officials of varying parties. Achebe became saddened by the evidence of corruption
                        and silencing of political opposition.“
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong> Arrow of God</strong> “Achebe's third book, Arrow of God, was published in 1964. Like its predecessors, it explores the intersections of Igbo tradition and European Christianity. Set in the village of Umuaro at the start
                        of the twentieth century, the novel tells the story of Ezeulu, a Chief Priest of Ulu. Shocked by the power of British intervention in the area, he orders his son to learn the foreigners' secret. Ezeulu is consumed by the resulting
                        tragedy. “
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong> A Man of the People</strong> “A Man of the People was published in 1966. A bleak satire set in an unnamed African state which has just attained independence, the novel follows a teacher named Odili Samalu from the village
                        of Anata who opposes a corrupt Minister of Culture named Nanga for his Parliament seat. Upon reading an advance copy of the novel, Achebe's friend John Pepper Clark declared: "Chinua, I know you are a prophet. Everything in this
                        book has happened except a military coup!" “
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong> Nigeria-Biafra War</strong> “In May 1967, the southeastern region of Nigeria broke away to form the Republic of Biafra; in July the Nigerian military attacked to suppress what it considered an unlawful rebellion. Achebe's
                        colleague, Christopher Okigbo, who had become a close friend of the family (especially of Achebe's son, young Ikechukwu), volunteered to join the secessionist army while simultaneously working at the press. Achebe's house was bombed
                        one afternoon; Christie had taken the children to visit her sick mother, so the only victims were his books and papers. The Achebe family narrowly escaped disaster several times during the war. Five days later, Christopher Okigbo
                        was killed on the war's front line. Achebe was shaken considerably by the loss; in 1971 he wrote "Dirge for Okigbo", originally in the Igbo language but later translated to English. “
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong> Postwar academia</strong> “After the war, Achebe helped start two magazines: the literary journal Okike, a forum for African art, fiction, and poetry; and Nsukkascope, an internal publication of the University (motto:
                        "Devastating, Fearless, Brutal and True"). Achebe and the Okike committee later established another cultural magazine, Uwa Ndi Igbo, to showcase the indigenous stories and oral traditions of the Igbo community. In February 1972
                        he released Girls at War, a collection of short stories ranging in time from his undergraduate days to the recent bloodshed. It was the 100th book in Heinemann's African Writers Series. “
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong> Criticism of Conrad</strong> “Achebe expanded this criticism when he presented a Chancellor's Lecture at Amherst on 18 February 1975, 'An Image of Africa: Racism in Conrad's "Heart of Darkness"'. Decrying Joseph Conrad
                        as "a bloody racist", Achebe asserted that Conrad's famous novel dehumanises Africans, rendering Africa as "a metaphysical battlefield devoid of all recognisable humanity, into which the wandering European enters at his peril."
                        “
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong> Retirement and politics</strong> “In 1982, Achebe retired from the University of Nigeria. He devoted more time to editing Okike and became active with the left-leaning People's Redemption Party (PRP). In 1983, he became
                        the party's deputy national vice-president. He published a book called The Trouble with Nigeria to coincide with the upcoming elections. On the first page, Achebe says bluntly: "the Nigerian problem is the unwillingness or inability
                        of its leaders to rise to the responsibility and to the challenge of personal example which are the hallmarks of true leadership." The elections that followed were marked by violence and charges of fraud. Asked whether he thought
                        Nigerian politics had changed since A Man of the People, Achebe replied: "I think, if anything, the Nigerian politician has deteriorated." After the elections, he engaged in a heated argument – which almost became a fistfight –
                        with Bakin Zuwo, the newly elected governor of Kano State. He left the PRP and afterwards kept his distance from political parties, expressing his sadness at the dishonesty and weakness of the people involved.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong> Anthills and paralysis</strong> “On 22 March 1990, Achebe was riding in a car to Lagos when an axle collapsed and the car flipped. His son Ikechukwu and the driver suffered minor injuries, but the weight of the vehicle
                        fell on Achebe and his spine was severely damaged. He was flown to the Paddocks Hospital in Buckinghamshire, England, and treated for his injuries. In July doctors announced that although he was recuperating well, he was paralyzed
                        from the waist down and would require the use of a wheelchair for the rest of his life. Soon afterwards, Achebe became the Charles P. Stevenson Professor of Languages and Literature at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York;
                        he held the position for more than fifteen years. In 1999, Achebe was awarded the St. Louis Literary Award from the Saint Louis University Library Associates. In the autumn of 2009, he joined the Brown University faculty as the
                        David and Marianna Fisher University Professor of Africana Studies. “

                    <li>
                        <strong> Later in his life as a publisher</strong> “In October 2012, Achebe's publishers, Penguin Books, released There Was a Country: A Personal History of Biafra. Publication immediately caused a stir and re-opened the discussion
                        about the Nigerian Civil War. It would prove to be the last publication during his lifetime. Fondly called the "father of African literature", Achebe died after a short illness on 21 March 2013 in Boston, United States. An unidentified
                        source close to the family said that he was ill for a while and had been hospitalised in the city. Penguin publishing director Simon Winder said: "... we are all desolate to hear of his death." The New York Times described him
                        in his obituary as "one of Africa's most widely read novelists and one of the continent's towering men of letters". The BBC wrote that he was "revered throughout the world for his depiction of life in Africa". He was laid to rest
                        in his hometown in Ogidi, Anambra State. “
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong> Oral tradition</strong> “The style of Achebe's fiction draws heavily on the oral tradition of the Igbo people. He weaves folk tales into the fabric of his stories, illuminating community values in both the content and
                        the form of the storytelling. The tale about the Earth and Sky in Things Fall Apart, for example, emphasises the interdependency of the masculine and the feminine. Although Nwoye enjoys hearing his mother tell the tale, Okonkwo's
                        dislike for it is evidence of his imbalance. Later, Nwoye avoids beatings from his father by pretending to dislike such "women's stories".“
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong> Use of English</strong> “As the decolonisation process unfolded in the 1950s, a debate about choice of language erupted and pursued authors around the world; Achebe was no exception. Indeed, because of his subject matter
                        and insistence on a non-colonial narrative, he found his novels and decisions interrogated with extreme scrutiny – particularly with regard to his use of English. One school of thought, championed by Kenyan writer Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o,
                        urged the use of indigenous African languages. English and other European languages, he said in 1986, were "part of the neo-colonial structures that repress progressive ideas".“
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong> Themes</strong> “Achebe's novels approach a variety of themes. In his early writing, a depiction of the Igbo culture itself is paramount. Critic Nahem Yousaf highlights the importance of these depictions: "Around the tragic
                        stories of Okonkwo and Ezeulu, Achebe sets about textualising Igbo cultural identity". The portrayal of indigenous life is not simply a matter of literary background, he adds: "Achebe seeks to produce the effect of a precolonial
                        reality as an Igbo-centric response to a Eurocentrically constructed imperial 'reality' ". Certain elements of Achebe's depiction of Igbo life in Things Fall Apart match those in Olaudah Equiano's autobiographical Narrative. Responding
                        to charges that Equiano was not actually born in Africa, Achebe wrote in 1975: "Equiano was an Igbo, I believe, from the village of Iseke in the Orlu division of Nigeria".“
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong> Culture and colonialism</strong> “A prevalent theme in Achebe's novels is the intersection of African tradition (particularly Igbo varieties) and modernity, especially as embodied by European colonialism. The village of
                        Umuofia in Things Fall Apart, for example, is violently shaken with internal divisions when the white Christian missionaries arrive. Nigerian English professor Ernest N. Emenyonu describes the colonial experience in the novel as
                        "the systematic emasculation of the entire culture". Achebe later embodied this tension between African tradition and Western influence in the figure of Sam Okoli, the president of Kangan in Anthills of the Savannah. Distanced
                        from the myths and tales of the community by his Westernised education, he does not have the capacity for reconnection shown by the character Beatrice. The colonial impact on the Igbo in Achebe's novels is often effected by individuals
                        from Europe, but institutions and urban offices frequently serve a similar purpose. The character of Obi in No Longer at Ease succumbs to colonial-era corruption in the city; the temptations of his position overwhelm his identity
                        and fortitude. The courts and the position of District Commissioner in Things Fall Apart likewise clash with the traditions of the Igbo, and remove their ability to participate in structures of decision-making. “
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <strong> Masculinity and femininity</strong> “The gender roles of men and women, as well as societies' conceptions of the associated concepts, are frequent themes in Achebe's writing. He has been criticised as a sexist author,
                        in response to what many call the uncritical depiction of traditionally patriarchal Igbo society, where the most masculine men take numerous wives, and women are beaten regularly. Paradoxically, Igbo society immensely values individual
                        achievement but also sees the ownership over or acquisition of women as a signifier of success. As seen in Things Fall Apart, Igbo society condemns violence but Okonkwo's ability to control 'his' women is inextricably connected
                        to his dignity. Thus, women are automatically disenfranchised in terms of achieving high status related to personal achievement. Others suggest that Achebe is merely representing the limited gendered vision of the characters, and
                        they note that in his later works, he tries to demonstrate the inherent dangers of excluding women from society. It is also suggested that Achebe purposefully created exaggerated gender binaries in order to render Igbo history
                        recognizable to international readers. Still others suggest that reading Achebe through a womanist lens enables an understanding of Igbo conceptions of gender complementarity. Womanism is "an afrocentric concept forged out of global
                        feminism to analyze the condition of Black African women" that acknowledges the patriarchal oppression of women, but also highlights the resistance and dignity of African women. As the representation of Igbo society and kinship
                        structures in novels such as Things Fall Apart differs considerably from the work of African feminist anthropology, the representation should not be taken literally; rather, the reader should consider the roles of both women and
                        men as intentionally stark and in opposition. In any case, a careful reading of Achebe paradoxically recognizes the hyperbolic representation of gender politics in Igbo society, while acknowledging the necessary nuance that gives
                        Achebe's women some agency and prominence. Achebe's first central female character in a novel is Beatrice Nwanyibuife in Anthills of the Savannah. As an independent woman in the city, Beatrice strives for the balance that Okonkwo
                        lacked so severely. She refutes the notion that she needs a man, and slowly learns about Idemili, a goddess balancing the aggression of male power. Although the final stages of the novel show her functioning in a nurturing mother-type
                        role, Beatrice remains firm in her conviction that women should not be limited to such capacities. “

                    <li>
                        <strong> Legacy</strong> “Achebe has been called "the father of modern African writing" and Africa's greatest storyteller, and many books and essays have been written about his work over the past fifty years. In 1992 he became
                        the first living writer to be represented in the Everyman's Library collection published by Alfred A. Knopf. His 60th birthday was celebrated at the University of Nigeria by "an international Who's Who in African Literature". One
                        observer noted: "Nothing like it had ever happened before in African literature anywhere on the continent." Despite his scholarly achievements and the global importance of his work, Achebe never received a Nobel Prize, which some
                        observers viewed as unjust. When Wole Soyinka was awarded the 1986 Nobel Prize in Literature, Achebe joined the rest of Nigeria in celebrating the first African ever to win the prize. He lauded Soyinka's "stupendous display of
                        energy and vitality", and said he was "most eminently deserving of any prize". In 1988 Achebe was asked by a reporter for Quality Weekly how he felt about never winning a Nobel Prize; he replied: "My position is that the Nobel
                        Prize is important. But it is a European prize. It's not an African prize ... Literature is not a heavyweight championship. Nigerians may think, you know, this man has been knocked out. It's nothing to do with that.” On 16 November
                        2017, Google showed a Doodle in Nigeria and the U.S. for Chinua Achebe's 87th birthday. On Achebe's 86th birthday in 2016, young writers in Anambra State initiated and started hosting an annual literary festival in his honour,
                        known as the Chinua Achebe Literary Festival. “
